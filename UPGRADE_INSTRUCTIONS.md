index.html                     ⏳ Needs manual update
package.json                   ⏳ May need dependencies
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Upgrade

### Step 1: Backup Current Files
Your original main.js has been backed up as `main.js.backup`

### Step 2: Update package.json

Add/verify these dependencies:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dat.gui": "^0.7.9",
    "gsap": "^3.11.4",
    "three": "^0.149.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Switch to New Main File

**Option A: Rename files (Recommended)**
```bash
mv main.js main-old.js
mv main-new.js main.js
```

**Option B: Update index.html**
Change the script tag in index.html from:
```html
<script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
```
to:
```html
<script type="module" src="/main-new.js"></script>
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 5: Test Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 and test:
- ✅ Light/Dark mode toggle (right side button)
- ✅ About Me section (click "About Me" in nav)
- ✅ Projects view (click "Projects" in nav)
- ✅ Contact form (click "Get In Touch")
- ✅ Custom cursor (desktop only)
- ✅ Scroll progress bar (top of page)
- ✅ Back to top button (bottom right, appears on scroll)
- ✅ Project filtering and search
- ✅ All 30 projects load correctly

### Step 6: Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

Check for:
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ All assets copied to dist/
- ✅ File sizes are reasonable

### Step 7: Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

Test the production build thoroughly before deploying.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: Make sure all files in `src/` directory exist
```bash
ls -la src/core/
ls -la src/components/
ls -la src/data/
ls -la src/styles/
```

### Issue: Theme toggle not appearing
**Solution**: The ThemeManager creates it automatically. Check console for errors.

### Issue: Projects not showing
**Solution**:
1. Check that `/src/data/projects.js` exists
2. Verify image paths are correct
3. Check browser console for loading errors

### Issue: 3D model not loading
**Solution**:
1. Verify `/public/models/room.glb` exists
2. Check `/public/draco/` folder has decoder files
3. Open Network tab to see failed requests

### Issue: Styles look broken
**Solution**:
1. Verify `style.css` has enhanced styles appended
2. Check that `/src/styles/enhanced.css` exists
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
npm install
npm run build
```

## 📝 Customization Priorities

Once everything works, customize these in order:

1. **Projects Data** (`/src/data/projects.js`)
   - Replace placeholder projects with your real projects
   - Update images, URLs, and descriptions

2. **Color Scheme** (`style.css` - `:root` section)
   - Change accent colors
   - Adjust light/dark theme colors

3. **About Section** (`index.html`)
   - Update your bio text
   - Modify tech stack badges
   - Update resume link

4. **Contact Integration** (`/src/components/ContactForm.js`)
   - Add backend API endpoint for form submission
   - Integrate with email service (EmailJS, SendGrid, etc.)

5. **3D Scene** (`main-new.js`)
   - Adjust camera positions
   - Modify lighting intensity
   - Change particle count/colors
